# Grokomatic Journey

Grokomatic started out as an experiment to try out the Grok API, then became a personal challenge to see if I could use it to automatically generate a social media post, and lastly became a video series. If you want a walkthrough of the code you can view it on [Tiger Triangle Technologies YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TigerTriangleTech).

**Note:** This will work with any Open AI compliant API, not just Grok.

I am making it public in case it helps others with any of the following:
- Basic structure and configuration of a .NET console app.
- Using Open AI compliant API to generate text.
- Using generative AI to create an image related to the text.
- Programmatically posting on X (formerly Twitter).
- Programmatically posting on Facebook.
- Programmatically posting on Instagram.
- Publish and automate running the application on a schedule.
